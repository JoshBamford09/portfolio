    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a 21 year old IT analyst currently working for the number 1 Home Care company in the world. 
        I have had this position for almost 3 years now, but am hoping for a career change ealry next year
        after completing 24-week bootcamp to train me to become a junior developer.
    </p>
    <p>Mr James Parr was my computer science teacher back in 2017, and he believed that I would go on to 
        have a career in the coding industry when  I was older as he believed I had a passion and drive 
        for the subject of Computer Science. After working in the IT industry for so long as an analyst now 
        I belive it is time to change what I do so that work is no longer just a place I go to to get paid, 
        but a place where I enjoy what I do and somewhere I can make a difference.
